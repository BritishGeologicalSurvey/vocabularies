They were formerly well exposed in the Tottenhill Gravel Pit, where two units were evident. A lower unit up to 5 m thick consists of medium to coarse, poorly sorted, mostly angular gravels with cross-bedding dipping steeply (20 to 25 degrees) to the southeast, and with frost wedge and cryoturbation structures. The gravels contain numerous pebbles of woody and reedy peat, soft brown clay, varved clay and Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous erratics. The upper unit is about 3.5 m thick and consists of fine- and medium-grained gravels, which are better sorted than the lower gravels, and have a planar cross-bedding dipping westwards at 8 to 15 degrees. The junction of the two units is marked by a well-defined, slightly uneven surface along which the upper gravels truncate cryturbation and bedding structures in the lower gravel. The lower unit has no known outcrop."@en .

A detailed account is given in Bristow and Gregory (1982). Borehooles have yielded a sparse foraminiferal fauna. The Woolpit Beds are underlain and overlain by chalky till. It is generally assumed that the till is Lowestoft Formation, although this had not been proved."@en .
