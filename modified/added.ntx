Traces of pyrite, glauconite and chert have been reported. The limestones are white to pale grey, occasionally medium grey and buff. The mudstones are sub-fissile, carbonaceous, non-calcareous to calcareous, hard to soft, and finely laminated in part. They are dark grey to black and locally red-brown or varicoloured. In the South Viking Graben, thin, glauconitic, quartzose sandstones are present in the lower part of the Herring Formation (e.g. 16/28-7)."@en .

The limestones are white to pale grey and occasionally pink, red brown and pale green and variably argillaceous. The mudstones are dark grey and reddish brown. Traces of pink waxy tuff were reported by Deegan and Scull (1977). Thin, pale grey, glauconitic and calcareous, quartzose sandstones are locally present in the Inner Moray Firth (Andrews et al., 1990) and the South Viking Graben (e.g. 16/28-7). Traces of chert are also present locally. The Hidra Formation becomes more argillaceous northwards, and in the North Viking Graben it grades laterally into the more argillaceous Svarte Formation."@en .

Locally, however, softer argillaceous chalky limestones are interbedded with the harder, purer limestones (e.g. 16/28-7). Cored sections reveal the presence of beds of relatively porous, slumped and chaotically bedded chalky limestone (Kennedy, 1980); these are marked by low velocity peaks and by distinctive porosity and dipmeter log responses. These reworked facies comprise the main reservoir intervals in the oilfields of the Norwegian Central North Sea."@en .

It is usually marked by the base of a thin, but widespread limestone bed and corresponds to a slight downward increase in gamma-ray values and downward decrease in velocity (e.g. 22/1- 2A). Locally, however, wireline-log signatures suggest that the basal beds of the Hidra Formation are absent (e.g. 14/20-6A). As noted by Crittenden et al. (1991), care is needed in identifying the base of the Hidra Formation, because the wireline-log character of its lower part is closely similar to that of the upper Rødby Formation. Consequently, detailed biostratigraphic analysis is required in some sections before the boundary can be accurately placed. On intrabasinal highs, the Hidra Formation locally rests unconformably on the Carrack Formation (e.g. 16/28-7) or pre-Cretaceous rocks."@en .
