It shows an upward change from thin multistorey sandstones in a background of red mudstones and siltstones to thicker single-storey sandstones and eventually into stacked, pebbly sandstone-based fining-upwards units. It is only present in the southernmost outcrops at Freshwater West, where it is 55 m thick and crops out in the cliffs and foreshore [SR 8876 9885]. \r\n\r\nThe upper sequence (the Stackpole Sandstone Member) comprises a lower mudstone-rich heterolithic facies association and an upper trough cross-bedded and parallel-laminated sandstone association.
