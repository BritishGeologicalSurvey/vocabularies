Most of these sampled the prograding wedge on the outer shelf, which was proved to consist of an interbedded sequence of sands and muds (e.g. 82/10, 84/04). The sands are compact and firm, display a range of colours, including dark grey, grey brown, greenish grey and olive grey, are generally poorly sorted, very fine- to very coarse-grained, and slightly muddy, with common scattered pebbles, shell debris, and occasional glauconite. By way of variation, sands in the lower part of 84/04 are very fine- to fine-grained and well-sorted. The top of this sand unit may coincide with a shift in log response, although the signal is muted due to the start of the 'thicker' drill collars. The interbedded muds vary from very dark grey to yellowish brown, are commonly firm to hard, and also contain scattered pebbles and shell fragments. The sand facies is predominant in the recovered cores, consistent with the natural gamma-log signatures. There are also subordinate interbeds of laminated to thin-bedded sands and muds, and rare gravel bands (e.g. 84/04), sporadic lignites (e.g. 202/8-1), and thin limestones and siltstones (e.g. 206/8-2). \r\n\r\nThe deeper-water slope succession, in front of the prograding wedge, was tested by a few commercial wells with variable recovery. On the upper to middle slope, well 208/15-1A proved an interbedded sequence of sands and muds comparable to the outer shelf, with the sand facies similarly dominant. In contrast to the outer shelf, the muds were generally softer. Thin limestones were reported from well 208/27-1. A significant change in the nature of the slope-apron occurs to the north of Shetland where wells 219/20-1 and 219/28-1 document a mud-dominated succession on the North Sea Fan. \r\n\r\nThe basinal succession has not been sampled, although the predominance of sediment-drift deposits implies relatively fine-grained lithologies. A high terrigenous component is likely due to the proximity of the West Shetland and Faroe shelves, although information from the Rockall Trough (cf.

The diamictons may vary from massive to crudely stratified, and from matrix- to clast-supported. \r\n\r\nThe slope and basinal facies comprises a variable ratio of interbedded debris flows and glacimarine and marine deposits (Paul et al., 1998; King et al., 1996; Stoker et al., 1998).

The gravel is matrix-supported and randomly orientated. Sporadic shell fragments indicate a shelf-derived fauna. \r\n\r\nThe glacimarine and marine strata, which comprise the acoustically-layered strata, consist of interbedded, normally- to lightly-overconsolidated, muds, sandy muds, sandy silts and muddy sands.

In more proximal sections, the basal beds of the Flett Formation are generally more sandy, and the uppermost sediments of the Faroe Group are more variable in lithology, rendering the boundary more difficult to define on lithology alone. In all sections where the top of the Faroe Group is in mudstone facies, the boundary is marked by a major increase in the abundance of foraminifera, particularly the distinctive agglutinated Bathysiphon/Rhabdammina type.
