The sandstones are mostly white or brownish grey in colour. They are rather variable in grain size, but sorting is moderate or good, and grainstone textures predominate. Ferroan calcite cement can comprise up to 40 per cent of the total rock (e.g. in the Claymore Field, Maher and Harker, 1987). The siltstones and mudstones are generally grey or dark grey, but are occasionally yellowish green, purple, or reddish brown. A few thin beds of white and brownish grey, microcrystalline limestone have been recorded from the Forth Approaches Basin. A thin bed of oolitic limestone was also encountered in well 26/7-1, but contemporary limestones are notably rare or absent in the Outer Moray Firth Basin (Leeder and Boldy, 1990). Sandstone constitutes between 10 and 50 per cent, siltstone and mudstone between 50 and 90 per cent, and coal up to 13 per cent of the Outer Moray Firth coal measures (Leeder and Boldy, 1990). \r\n\r\nLeeder and Boldy (1990) subdivided the Outer Moray Firth coal measures into five discrete lithofacies (Lithofacies 1 to 5).
