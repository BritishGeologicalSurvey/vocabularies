The mudstone is well laminated in the lower part, with light to medium grey indurated siliceous mudstone alternating with medium to dark grey soft, fissile mudstone. In the upper part, the mudstone is fissile, but soft and poorly laminated. In parts of the Viking Graben, the tuff-rich mudstones include thin reddish grey layers, often with diffuse boundaries, and often associated with minor bioturbation. \r\n\r\nThe tuffs mostly occur as thin layers up to a few centimetres in thickness, with sharp bases and commonly displaying normal size grading; these are interpreted as undisturbed air-fall tuffs. Several cored sections in the Viking Graben have revealed units several tens of centimeteres thick that are internally structureless or display dewatering structures; such units are interpreted as resulting from grvity-flow resedimentation of the primary air-fall tuff (Malm et al. 1984). Sporadic calcite-cemented concretions or concretionary beds are present in some sections, as indicated by high-velocity spikes (e.g. 9/18a-15). \r\n\r\nSandstone units up to 200 m thick occur in the Balder Formation in central and northern parts of the Viking Graben; thinner sandstone units occur in southwestern parts of the Central Graben (principally Quadrant 29). The sandstones are typically well sorted, clean and poorly cemented, although tightly cemented sandstones occur locally. In the Viking Graben, some sandstones in the upper part of the formation are believed to have been emplaced by injection from lower levels. The sandstone units in 204/9-1 and 205/16-1 may be informally referred to as the 'Balder Sandstone'."@en .

Successions are mainly upward-coarsening units (5-7 in number). Local upward-fining units occur. In general an upward coarsening unit comprises dark grey, micaceous, carbonaceous and pyritic mudstones, locally with shell debris, through grey and brown, fine-grained, flaser-bedded and ripple-laminated silty sandstone to clean, fine- to medium-grained, locally oolitic, cross-bedded or parallel-laminated sandstones. A thin lignitic coal may also occur. Bioturbation is common and shells and Rhaxella spicules occur at many levels. Phosphatic nodules are also present at some intervals."@en .

Its top is marked by a prominent brecciated siderite-cemented mudstone horizon (Bed 1 of Hurst, 1981). Overlying Bed 1 are about 15 m of grey and black, laminated, bituminous fissile mudstones, some of which approach oil shale composition. Two coals are developed in this succession (the Inverbrora Member), including a thin coal developed about 8 m below the top of the formation and a prominent seam, 1 m thick, forming the uppermost bed and termed the Brora Coal (Bed). Biota is relatively sparse and comprises bivalves, plant debris and fish scales. Two bivalve-rich beds, largely comprising Isognomon and Neomiodon are present between 3 and 4 m below the top of the formation and these beds were interpreted as a maximum flooding surface by Stephen and Davies (1998). \r\n\r\nOffshore, in the Inner Morray Firth, the formation comprises interbedded, dark grey, carbonaceous, waxy mudstones and greenish grey sandy mudstones, sandstones and coals. Mudstones, which contain sideritic spheres, show convolute bedding. Sandstones are white to pale grey, well sorted and fine- to medium-grained, with cross-bedding and ripple lamination. The sandstones have a sharp base and grade up into mottled, bioturbated and veined mudstone with rootlets and coaly zones.  Cyclicity can be recognised in the sandstones (Linsley et al., 1980; Stevens, 1991). Coals occur at various levels in some localities (e.g. Well 11/25-1). At the top of the formation, a thin coaly section, which is probably equivalent to the 'Brora Coal Bed' onshore, varies from about 1m thick (e.g. Well 11/30-1) to thin seams within mudstones."@en .
