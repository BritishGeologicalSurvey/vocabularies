There is a corresponding slight downward decrease in gamma values and a more marked increase in sonic velocity. There is considerable variability in the sonic response over the formation as a whole as a result of the cyclic interbedding of thin argillaceous units, hard chalks and occasional hard chert-rich bands. The top of the unit is often marked by a thin, hard chalk unit (e.g. well 49/5-1)."@en .
