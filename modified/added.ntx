Interbedded with these are a unit of calcareous siltstone (Coldwell Siltstone Formation) and units of turbiditic sandstone (Birk Riggs Sandstone Formation in the south-west Lake District, and the Austwick Sandstone Formation in the Craven inliers). The nomenclature is distinct in the Craven inliers (Arthurton et al., 1988), reflecting the subtle differences in lithofacies. \r\n\r\nWenlock to lower Ludlow (lowest Gorstian)."@en .
