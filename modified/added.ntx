Sections at the centre of the East Shetland Basin and in parts of the Beryl Embayment are dominated by mudstone, whereas the formation is largely composed of sandstone near the East Shetland Platform and Crawford Spur. The coarsest and least sorted sandstones occur in the west, where they are locally underlain by conglomerate composed of pebbles of sandstone, shale, and of metamorphic and granitic basement rock types in a coarse sandy matrix. The sandstones locally contain grains of feldspar towards the base of the formation, and of glauconite or chlorite at higher levels. The sediments are commonly micaceous and sometimes calcareous. The limestones are white, pale grey, pale brown or pink, and are commonly argillaceous; most have a microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline texture. \r\n\r\nMany sections display upward-coarsening cycles over part or all of the succession, with individual cycles ranging from about 50 m to hundreds of metres in thickness."@en .

The formation comprises the whole of the Triassic north of the Halibut Horst and, despite partial erosion, it is also at its thickest in that area, up to 770 m of sediments having been drilled in central Quadrant 13. Roberts et al. (1990) estimated that up to 1200 m of Triassic deposits are present adjacent to the Wick Fault.
