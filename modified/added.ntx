The carbonates are massive or microcrystalline, commonly sucrosic, and locally porous and vuggy. Irregular gamma-ray and sonic log signatures are typical of many basin-margin sections, indicating that the dolomites are interbedded with more argillaceous facies (Deegan and Scull, 1977). In some basin-margin wells, high-gamma sections are partly related to the presence of mudstone beds, and partly to the presence of organic-rich dolomites. In more central parts of the basin (broadly defined by the distribution of the Shearwater Salt Formation), many sections display a unit of relatively low velocity argillaceous dolomites overlain by a unit of cleaner, anhydritic dolomites, generating a distinctive stepped profile on the sonic and resistivity logs (e.g. 21/11-1; 28/5-1). The basal dolomites are anhydritic at the northeastern flank of the Mid North Sea High (e.g. 30/29a-1)."@en .

Normally the sandstones are cemented by hematite and authigenic clay, but dolomite and anhydrite are locally important cements (Deegan and Scull, 1977), as is kaolinite (Trewin and Bramwell, 1991).

In many sections, it is composed of two carbonate units separated by a unit of anhydrite; in others it consists of carbonate alone (e.g. 28/5-1). The Argyll (Zl) and Innes (Z2) carbonate members are generally described as comprising light grey and pale brown dolomite and minor dolomitic limestones. However, their variable gamma-ray response (e.g. 20/2-2) suggests the presence also of sporadic laminae of mudstone or sapropelic dolomite. The Iris Anhydrite Member is almost entirely composed of white, pale pink or cream anhydrite. Thicker beds of grey, or occasionally pinkish grey or reddish brown mudstone form a significant component of the carbonate members in parts of the Moray Firth, generating irregular gammaray and sonic log motifs (Deegan and Scull, 1977). Concentrations of one or more highly radioactive mudstone beds occur towards the top of the Argyll Carbonate Member (e.g. 14/15-1) and near, or at the base of, the Innes Carbonate Member in many other areas, generating prominent gamma-ray peaks. Beds of fine to medium grained sandstone are interbedded with carbonate near the lateral transition to the Bosies Bank Formation."@en .
