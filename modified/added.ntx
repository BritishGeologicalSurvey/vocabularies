Thin beds of gypsum/anhydrite are widespread; thin sandstones are also present."@en .

In the East Midlands, the boundary with the underlying Sherwood Sandstone Group is sharp and unconformable (Warrington 1974, fig. 40; Howard et al., in press). The base of the group onlaps onto Carboniferous and older rocks at basin margins."@en .

+<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/MMG> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasUpperBoundaryDefinition> "The boundary with the overlying Penarth Group is typically a slight unconformity marked by an abrupt upward change from the green or grey-green, dolomitic mudstones of the Blue Anchor Formation to black, fossiliferous shales of the Westbury Formation (Penarth Group). The unconformity surface may be slightly irregular and small clasts of Blue Anchor Formation lithologies commonly occur at the base of the Westbury Formation. The Blue Anchor Formation may be burrowed or have animal borings to a depth of several centimetres below the unconformity surface."@en .
