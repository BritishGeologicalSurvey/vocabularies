Near the southern limit of the Basalanhydrit Formation, where it passes laterally into the Blakeney Formation, red mudstone is interbedded with anhydrite (e.g. 53/1-1).

Shelf sections are composed mainly of very fine oolitic, pelletoidal, bioclastic and pisolitic grainstones, and hard, microcrystalline carbonate mudstones (e.g. 41/8-1), and locally contain a restricted fauna of bivalves, gastropods, foraminifera and ostracods. Large pisoliths and algal sheets characterize the barrier facies developed near the shelf edge. Locally, the shelf facies overlies more argillaceous slope facies and this is reflected in a downward increase in gamma-ray values (e.g. 48/22-2, Clark, 1986, fig. 19). The slope facies consist largely of dark, thinly bedded and slumped, locally argillaceous and anhydritic, dolomitized lime mudstones, together with pelleted and burrowed, structureless, argillaceous, dolomitized lime mudstones (e.g. 48/22-2, Clark, 1986, fig. 19). Lenses and beds of oolitic and bioclastic grainstones occur in both the bedded and structureless slope deposits (Clark, 1986). The thin, basin-floor facies is made up of dark, finely laminated, organic-rich, argillaceous, carbonate mudstones (e.g. 44/21-1). Coarsely crystalline limestone predominates at the centre of the basin floor, and microcrystalline dolomite around its margins. Anhydrite laminae occur up to 2 m above the base, and recur near the top of the basin-floor carbonates (Taylor, 1980)."@en .

Thin partings of grey mudstone are common. The dolomite is locally pyritic and commonly contains secondary, soft, white, amorphous anhydrite (e.g. 48/30-3). Oolitic grainstones occur locally, particularly in the upper parts of marginal sections (e.g. 36/26-1 and 48/30-4). \r\n\r\nThe shelf facies pass basinwards into thick, slope facies consisting of dark brown, thinly bedded, unfossiliferous pyritic dolomite that contains abundant laths of replacive anhydrite (Taylor and Colter, 1975). Subordinate beds of beige or pale grey limestone are common towards the base (e.g. 49/22-3). Sporadic, thin interbeds of grey, brown or black mudstone and bituminous laminae (e.g. 41/25a-1) are present and generally more common in basal strata. \r\n\r\nIn the basin centre, the Plattendolomit Formation largely consists of white to medium grey, amorphous to cryptocrystalline anhydrite with laminations of bituminous mudstone and argillaceous dolomite (e.g. 42/10-1) and is often inseparable from the Hauptdolomit Formation (e.g. 44/11-1)."@en .

The Stassfurt Halite Formation consists of halite with subordinate interbedded anhydrite, polyhalite and kieserite. Minor amounts of carnallite are also present near the top of the formation. The halite is generally coarsely crystalline, transparent to translucent, locally coloured orange or pink, and occasionally white and opaque. The anhydrite is interbedded and intergrown with the halite and is generally white and amorphous to microcrystalline. The beds of polyhalite are white to pale grey, occasionally brick red, pink and orange, and amorphous to microcrystalline. A thin unit (usually about 1 m thick) of white to pale grey anhydrite (Deckanhydrit) commonly caps the formation.

The anhydrite is generally described as white or yellowish white to pale grey, soft to hard, amorphous or massive and microcrystalline with sporadic argillaceous beds. It occurs as nodules, enterolithic bands, large cumulous masses and replacement crystals associated with microcrystalline dolomite (Taylor and Colter, 1975). The interbedded dolomite is commonly described as pale grey to pale brown, dense, microcrystalline, argillaceous and anhydritic. Irregular, dark laminae are present in the dolomite, which in places has a vaguely pelletoid fabric (Taylor and Colter, 1975). \r\n\r\nThe thin basinal facies commonly consists of a vertical sequence of four anhydrite/carbonate couplets which are recognised from both core examination and wireline log responses (Taylor and Colter, 1975; Taylor, 1980).
