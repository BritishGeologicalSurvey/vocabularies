Three cycles of grading were interpreted; from bioturbated sandstones with thin siltstones at the base to cross-stratified sandstones at the top of the unit. Hasselbo et al. (1988, 1999) and Hesselbo and Coe (2000)  include this Member within their redefined Pabay Shale Formation, which has not been accepted by the British Geological Survey. It was originally the highest sandstone within the Broadford Beds and hence is now the highest Member within the Ardnish Formation, as defined by Morton (1999)."@en .
