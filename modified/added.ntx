West of South Molton, the lower boundary is taken at the incoming of dark grey to black, rarely fossiliferous slightly siliceous, finely laminated mudstones (Unit D of the Pilton Beds of Prentice, 1960), known to equate with the Doddiscombe Formation, above the fossiliferous mudstones with thin sandstones and siltstones of the underlying Pilton Mudstone Formation.
