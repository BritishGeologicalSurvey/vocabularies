Most of the surviving deposits are fluvial gravels, with sedimentary structures indicating deposition by a braided river. Lacustrine silts and clays and organic peats are uncommon. The formation represents the first significant input of far-travelled materials into the Thames river sediments, and is characterised by quartz and quartzite from the Triassic, Carboniferous and Devonian rocks of the West Midlands, Welsh Borderland and possibly southwestern Pennines, and felsic volcanic rocks from northern Wales. The presence of mega-erratics and glacially fractured sand grains indicate glacial erosion in the headwater regions of the river. The fluvial gravels occupy terrace levels and the members are defined on the basis of altitude and pebble clast content. The members comprise bodies of cross-bedded and massive, moderately sorted sand and gravel. The aggradations are generally entrenched into bedrock with a difference in surface elevation of at least 10 m."@en .
