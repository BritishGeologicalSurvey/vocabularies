A thin calcareous sandstone is present at Herne Bay. \r\n\r\nThe Reculver Sand Member is mid-Thanetian in age (NP8), based on microfossils (especially nannofossils) (King, in prep.) and magnetostratigraphy (Ali and Jolley, 1996)."@en .
+<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/UPR> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The Upnor Formation is typically composed of variably but commonly abundant glauconitic fine- to coarse-grained sand with variable clay and silt content, and with beds, lenses and stringers of well-rounded, black flint gravel, and minor thin clays, commonly interbedded with glauconitic sand laminae and lenses. When fresh, the sands are dark grey-brown to dark green depending on proportion of glauconite grains which may be more than 25%. In south-east London there is a persistent pebble bed at the top. The sands weather pale grey-brown to yellow-brown but the glauconite remains dark green. In the central and northern London Basin pedogenic processes during deposition of the overlying Reading Formation modified the sands, resulting in development of carbonate concretions, clay enrichment and colour mottling that exceptionally extend through the formation. Oysters are common in unweathered sections. \r\n\r\nThe Upnor Formation represents proximal marine sedimentation in predominantly high energy, partly tidally influenced environments. In contrast to that of the Thanet Formation, the heavy mineral content of the sands suggests a provenance from the south (Morton, 1982). \r\n\r\nPaleocene: Late Thanetian (NP9), based on calcareous nannofossil assemblages, dinoflagellate cysts and magnetostratigraphy (Ali and Jolley, 1996; Ellison et al., 1996; King, in prep.; Knox, 1996)."@en .
+<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/UPR> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLowerBoundaryDefinition> "In the eastern part of the London Basin, the Upnor Formation rests on silty fine-grained sand at a burrowed contact with the Thanet Formation, with burrows extending as much as 0.5 m into the Thanet Formation, or on a channelled erosion surface (King, in prep). The Upnor Formation is likely to be composed of medium to coarse-grained sand that is greener and commonly more gravelly than that of the Thanet Formation but in places has a confusingly similar lithology, especially where, as in the far east of the London Basin, bioturbation has produced a gradational junction (Ellison et al., 1994). According to Morton (1982), the top of the Thanet Formation has been leached during a period of exposure, probably with some erosion, prior to deposition of the Upnor Formation. \r\n\r\nIn the west of the London Basin, to the west of the Thanet Formation outcrop and subcrop, the Upnor Formation rests on a burrowed contact with chalk and flints of the Chalk Group, commonly modified by karstic dissolution. \r\n\r\nIn East Anglia, the Upnor Formation rests on a burrowed contact with the clay of the Ormesby Clay Member."@en .
