+<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/FWE> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The formation comprises green to dark grey granule- to pebble-grade exotic clast conglomerates interbedded with fine- to medium-grained sandstones and green-grey mudstones and finer-grained red sandstones and mudstones the latter of which contain well-developed calcrete palaeosol profiles, commonly with tubular morphology. Mottled red-green 'redoximorphic' pheneomena are common in both mudstone and sandstone lithologies. At Freshwater East the formation comprises four discrete green-grey heterolithic units that contain lingulid faunas, vertebrate (fish) spines, and a diverse ichnotaxa including Diplichnites, Palmichnium, Rusophycus, Isopodichnus, Striatichnium, Arenicolites and Helminthopsis (Morrissey et al., 2012). Coalified plant fragments are locally abundant (Edwards, 1979). Lingulid and fish faunas are also recorded at Gateholm Island."@en .

The basal conglomerate is of pebble to cobble grade, and is overlain by buff coloured, cross-stratified pebbly sandstone. \r\n\r\nAt Gateholm Island, the formation conformably overlies red pedified mudrocks of the Moor Cliffs Formation, its base being defined by a 0.6 m thick green-grey heterolithic unit comprising discontinuous, decimetre-thick lens-like exotic clast, granule-grade conglomerates which contain lingulids, Pachytheca, fish spines and fish fragments.
