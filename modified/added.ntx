Breccias occur at the base and top of the formation on the south Devon coast (Jeans, 1978), and may have been formed by penecontemporaneous solution of halite. Laminated and thinly interbedded sediments are commonly extensively bioturbated and show structures indicative of thixotropic deformation. Invertebrate and vertebrate macrofossils are present, locally in abundance, and miospores and burrows are common. The siltstones and finer sandstones show small-scale ripple drift cross-bedding; thicker sandstone beds show trough and planar cross-bedding. The proportion of fine to coarse clastics varies laterally within the formation. The thicker sandstone units, composed of several individual beds, have a lenticular geometry and occupy the inferred former courses of distributary channels in a deltaic or estuarine environment. Less arenaceous, mudstone- and siltstone-dominated successions represent intervening interdistributary areas. The formation is differentiated from the reddish brown, blocky weathering mudstones of adjacent formations by its predominantly greenish grey colour, the presence of a significant (though commonly subordinate) proportion of sandstone, the predominance of finely laminated lithologies throughout, and its comparatively fossiliferous nature. The formation is characterised by an exotic clay mineral assemblage, which is rich in mixed-layer clays and distinct from the illite-dominated units below and above (Jeans 1978, Bloodworth and Prior, 1993; Carney et al., 2004; Jeans et al., 2005). \r\n\r\nLate Triassic, late Carnian (Tuvalian), on palynological evidence."@en .

The mudstones are mostly structureless, with a blocky weathering habit, but units up to 15 m thick of interlaminated mudstone and siltstone occur in parts of the formation, notably in the Bollin and Byley Mudstone members of the Cheshire Basin (Wilson, 1993) and in the Radcliffe Member of the East Midlands (Charsley et al., 1990; Howard et al., in press). Heterolithic units consisting of several thin beds of grey-green dolomitic siltstone and very fine-grained sandstone, interbedded with mudstone, occur at intervals throughout the formation. These units range from a few centimetres up to 4 m thick, and locally form mappable cuesta features. Named examples include the Cotgrave Sandstone Member and Clarborough Member of the East Midlands (Smith et al., 1973; Warrington et al., 1980; Charsley et al., 1990) and the Weatheroak Sandstone of the Redditch area (old et al., 1991). The Redcliffe Sandstone Member, a distinctive, deep red calcareous and ferruginous sandstone, is a marginal facies of the formation developed locally in the Bristol area (Kellaway and Welch, 1993). Units of halite up to 400 m thick are present at several stratigraphical levels in the thicker basinal sequences in west Lancashire and south Cumbria, Cheshire, Staffordshire, north-east Yorkshire, Worcestershire, Somerset and Dorset. Breccias produced by contemporaneous solution of salt are common throughout the formation. In the Cheshire Basin, more recent salt solution (some induced artificially by brine pumping activities) gives rise to solution hollows and collapse breccias associated with the halite members. Gypsum/anhydrite also occurs throughout the formation as\r\nnodules and veins."@en .

The sandstones are mostly very fine- to fine-grained, well sorted, and micaceous. They are typically cemented by ferroan calcite or dolomite. Sandstone beds are commonly less than 0.5 m thick, though composite units, consisting of several individual sandstone beds, may reach over 5 m thick. Intraformational mudclast conglomerates are common, with mudclasts concentrated at the bases of sandstone beds. Conglomerates with extraformational pebbles are rare and tend to be less than 1 m thick; the \"Waterstones Conglomerate\" of Nottinghamshire is a notable example (Elliott, 1961). Most mudstone and siltstone beds are reddish brown, though green-grey mottles and laminae are common. Gypsum occurs sporadically in the mudstones as small nodules. The sandstones are grey-brown and substantially paler than the siltstones and mudstones. Bedding is generally planar. Most beds are tabular and laterally extensive, though channel sandstones occur and typically have incised, erosional bases. The upper surfaces of sandstones and coarse siltstones are commonly wave or current rippled; in section the sandstones are usually planar or ripple-laminated, and exhibit sporadic rootlets."@en .

In the Cheshire Basin the junction between the Tarporley Siltstone Formation and the underlying Helsby Sandstone Formation is complex, being both transitional and diachronous, and locally there is a lateral passage between the two formations. For example, in the south-east of the basin, in the Stoke-on-Trent district (Rees and Wilson, 1998), siltstones, mudstones and thin sandstones (like those of the Tarporley Siltstone) alternate with thicker sandstones of Helsby Sandstone type; here the finer grained lithologies are included within the latter formation. This succession passes laterally into one where mudstones are dominant, assigned to the Tarporley Siltstone Formation. In the Nottingham area, the base of the unit is unconformable and is marked by a patchily distributed basal conglomerate up to 1 m thick with a strong calcareous cement (Howard, 2003; Howard et al., in press).
