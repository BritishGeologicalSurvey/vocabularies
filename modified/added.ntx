The Group is divided into four formations. Boundaries between these formations are diachronous, and in some cases strongly so.

One or more marine bands of dark grey or black shale may also be present towards the base of the formation, as such are present in onshore Westphalian A sections (refer to Ramsbottom et al., 1978). The A. vanderbeckei marine band has been identified near the top of the formation in cored sections from southern Quadrant 44. However, none of the marine bands forms a distinctive marker on the wireline logs. Coal seams up to 3 m thick constitute up to 5 per cent of the formation, and some may be very widespread. White and grey sandstone beds constitute between 15 and 45 per cent of the formation, and display a range of upward-fining, upward-coarsening, blocky, and ratty wireline-log responses. Bed thickness generally ranges between 1 and 25 m, but the reservoir sandstones of the Murdoch and Caister fields are up to 50 m thick. The thickest sandstones have sharp bases and mainly gradational tops, and are composite, stacked channel units, containing intervals of argillaceous and carbonaceous detritus that accumulated during periods of channel abandonment. Grain size of the sandstones is mainly very fine, fine, or occasionally medium, but some of the composite beds contain coarser pebbly horizons. Most of the sandstones are argillaceous, but the pebbly reservoir sandstones of the Caister and Murdoch fields are clean. Wireline log data enable cyclicity of sedimentation to be resolved on a variety of scales in most sections. Small-scale upward-coarsening cycles capped by a siltstone or sandstone bed, often overlain by a seat earth and coal seam, are commonly between 10 and 30 m, but are occasionally up to 50 m thick. Larger-scale cycles, defined by an upward increase in the proportion and thickness of sandstone beds, are exceptionally up to 300 m thick."@en .

Boote and Gustav (1987) recognised three main facies: \r\n\r\n1. Medium-grained, generally internally structureless (but with rare graded bedding) sandstones with rare thin mudstone beds, commonly arranged in sets up to c. 5 m thick. \r\n\r\n2. Medium- to thin bedded fine to medium-grained sandstones with common, interbedded, locally highly carbonaceous, mudstones. Sandstones are massive or have planar or ripple lamination. \r\n\r\n3. Medium to thick bedded, medium-grained sandstones in amalgamated sets, with beds of finely laminated and sporadically bioturbated mudstones. \r\n\r\nFurther facies were described by Turner (1984): \r\n\r\n1) coarse- to very coarse-grained sandstones with matrix-supported sandstone pebbles up to 6 mm across and 2) Bioturbated, very fine to fine-grained sandstone with oblique burrows and U-shaped burrows. \r\n\r\nTurner (1984) also noted load casts, flame structures, dish structures, small slump structures, soft sediment faults and water escape structures in otherwise massive sandstones. Matrix-supported, angular mudstone clasts (up to 2 cm in size) are locally common. \r\n\r\nIn the Claymore Field, the sandstones are subarkose and, locally, carbonate concretions occur (Maher and Harker, 1987). In the lower (early Volgian) part of the member in the Galley Field, sandstones are quartz-arenitic, but higher sandstones (Mid Volgian) there are feldspathic. \r\n\r\nThe thick bedded and amalgamated sandstones produce a 'blocky' gamma-ray log and the thin-bedded sandstones produce a 'ratty' log."@en .
