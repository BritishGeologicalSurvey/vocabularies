Generally capped by bored, encrusted hardground (mapped on sheets 234 (1972 edition) and 251 (1970 edition) as \"chinastone\" or \"Coppice Limestone\" (Cave, 1977)). Lateral passage north-east into peloidal packstones and wackestones of the Ardley Member (White Limestone Formation), and the lower part passes south-westwards by decrease in ooid content into the Tresham Rock Formation. At Minchinhampton Common, about 0.5m of very shelly calcareous mudstone and brownish coarse-grained ooidal limestone beds ('The Scroff') occur at the base of the formation (Channon, 1950). \r\n\r\nHigh energy shallow carbonate shelf with mobile ooid shoals."@en .

The formation includes a bored hardground on top of the Notgrove Member. \r\n\r\nShallow marine carbonate shelf. Mainly low energy conditions with carbonate mud deposition and terrigenous sediment influx, and a profuse shelly epifaunal biota. Higher energy conditions at times depositing coarser carbonate grains (ooids). \r\n\r\nDiscites Zone to Sauzei Zone."@en .
