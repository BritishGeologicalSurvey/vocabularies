Talus deposits include fallen rock debris, but here they are distinguished from landslip ('rockfall') deposits in that they are accumulations resulting largely from the spalling of rock fragments of all sizes due to natural weathering processes. They are not primarily due to rock falls which are usually joint-bounded masses or blocks breaking away from unstable slopes and triggered by non-weathering events such as seismic shocks and oversteepened scarps.
