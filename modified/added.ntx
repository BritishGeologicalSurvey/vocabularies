Siltstones and mudstones are grey, green, reddish-brown, occasionally red, micaceous and sometimes carbonaceous. Coal seams up to 3.5 m thick occur locally. \r\n\r\nIn the Beryl Embayment sandstone beds usually have sharp bases and frequently form upward fining cycles. Cross-bedding and ripple-lamination are present. Carbonized wood is present. Thin sandstones, which are interbedded with siltstones, mudstones and coal, show parallel to sub-parallel laminations, ripple laminations and water escape structures. The associated mudstones are mid-grey, generally blocky and massive (but occasionally fissile)."@en .

Underlain by fine-to medium-grained, buff, yellow and white sands with sparse calcareous \"doggers\" (the upper part of Swinnerton's 1937, \"Glauconitic Sands\"). The latter sands become coarser and greener towards the base of the Member. A bed of phosphatic nodules and small (generally chert) pebbles occurs at the base (the Mid Spilsby Nodule Bed of Casey, 1963, 1973). \r\n\r\nLower Spilsby Sandstone Member: Coarse-grained, pebbly, glauconitic sands and sandstones with calcareous \"doggers\" and sporadic phosphatic nodules towards the top (this unit equates with the lower part of Swinnerton's, 1937, \"Glauconitic Sands\"). The base of the Member comprises a thin grey sandstone with phosphatic nodules (the \"Basement Beds\" of Swinnerton, 1937, and Beds A and D of Swinnerton, 1935). \r\n\r\nOffshore, the Spilsby Sandstone consists of grey to white, poorly to well cemented, very fine- to medium- grained sandstone with interbedded green to blue-green, firm to fissile mudstone. Glauconitic and phosphatic grains are common. Pebbly phosphatic horizons within and at the base of some sequences produce prominent gamma-ray spikes on wireline logs. The upper part of the formation comprises more massive sandstones and the lower part of the formation contains more interbedded mudstones (e.g. Well 48/17a-2). On this basis the formation has been informally divided (SP1 and SP2) by Lott and Knox (1994)."@en .

Sandstones are very fine- to coarse- grained, pebbly, generally poorly consolidated, locally argillaceous and poorly sorted. They are pale grey to grey brown, dominantly quartz sandstones. Glauconite grains, carbonaceous debris and lignite are widespread. Calcareous concretions are common and give high velocity spikes on wireline logs. The Mudstones and siltstones are similar to those of the Valhall formation. They are generally calcareous, medium to dark grey, occasionally pale grey, grey-brown, red-brown and grey-green. They are micromicaceous, pyritic, glauconitic and blocky. Sporadic, thin, white to tan, argillaceous, microcrystalline limestones occur. \r\n\r\nThe Wick Sandstone Formation displays both blocky and serrated signatures on wireline logs, reflecting the massive sandstones units and thinly interbedded sandstones and mudstones units, respectively. \r\n\r\nIn the Inner Moray Firth the formation can be divided into three members (Captain, Coracle and Punt Sandstone members)."@en .
