Pebbles concentrations often form basal lags of upward-fining beds. Cross-bedding, wave-rippled lamination and burrows occur in places. Occasional thin mudstone beds with marine fossils also occur in some parts of the sequence, and can be recognised in geophysical logs by their distinct gamma-ray peaks (a large peak is often seen in the middle part of the formation). \r\n\r\nBeryl Embayment and South Viking Graben: The formation is composed almost entirely of fine-to coarse-grained, quartzose, mud-free sandstones. They are often kaolinitic. The sandstones are stacked in c. 8 m-thick, occasionally upward coarsening, units.  Sedimentary structures and bioturbation are rare. Near the top of the formation a unit of muddy sandstone, with carbonaceous wisps and laminae, causing relatively high gamma values, often occurs. Thin beds of pebbly, silty mudstone cause distinct gamma-ray peaks near the base and the middle of the formation."@en .

All thicknesses below are from Morton (1965) except where indicated. In Trotternish, north Skye, including the type section, the formation ranges from 156 to 228 m thick (see also Morton, 1976). On Strathaird [NG 52 11 to 56 21], it varies between 256 (Faoilean) and 488 m (southern tip), and on Raasay attains up to about 214 m. The succession at Glas Bheinn Beag [NG 585 257], near Dunan is approximately 235 m. On Ardnamurchan, the formation is between 20 m (British Geological Survey, 2009) and 37 m (Richey and Thomas, 1930) thick. Strata attributed to the formation on southeast Mull total about 30 m.
