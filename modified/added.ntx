It contains a much higher proportion of mudstone than the equivalent 'Millstone Grit' successions of the Central Province, than the modified Yoredale cyclothems of Northern England, or than successions containing orthoquartzitic Cefn-y-Fedw sandstones in North Wales (Ramsbottom, 1969a, 1974, 1978; Ramsbottom et al., 1978). Within the group the chief vertical and lateral facies variations are noted as follows: \r\n\r\n1. Sandstones occur in greater proportion in the upper part of the succession. \r\n\r\n2. A modified Yoredale facies, including sandstones and limestones, of H| age is developed over the crest and on the flanks of the Ramsey-Whitehaven Ridge. \r\n\r\n3. A thick sequence of thinly interbedded basinal limestone and calcareous mudstone is present in an axial facies belt (e.g. E,-?H, in 110/7b-6)."@en .

However, in a central E-W axial belt, much thicker sequences are thought to comprise thinly interbedded fine-grained bituminous limestones and calcareous mudstones which are closely comparable with similar lithologies along the depositional strike in the onshore Craven Basin (Ribblesdale Fold Belt; Aitkenhead et al., 1992; Riley, 1990; Gawthorpe, 1987). This axial basinal facies has not been penetrated offshore to date. Adjacent to the Ramsey-Whitehaven Ridge, a shallow marine Yoredale facies is predicted in the highest strata along the depositional strike from a similar facies in west Cumbria."@en .

Strata of Langsettian to early Bolsovian age comprise grey coal-bearing, upward-coarsening cyclothems of delta plain origin (Guion and Fielding, 1988). More arenaceous, fluviatile cycles of late Bolsovian to Westphalian D age (cf. Besly, 1988; Ramsbottom et al., 1978; Hamblin and Coppack, 1995) comprise primary red (and subordinate grey) upward-fining units.

Precise recognition of the lower boundary of the Kidston Group is unsatisfactory using spore dating and analysis from cuttings, and is dependent chiefly on identification of the wireline log signature of the Subcrenatum Marine Band - generally a high gamma mudstone (Whittaker et al., 1985; Penn, 1987; Leeder et al., 1990) - or recovery of the eponymous goniatite. In the south, offshore to the west of the Vale of Clwyd Fault, the Subcrenatum Marine Band may be absent, and westwards, progressively higher strata of the Kidston Group are thought to rest unconformably on the Bisat Group and, locally, adjacent to Anglesey, on the Garwood Group (BGS, 1994; Williams and Eaton, 1993)."@en .

The zone of secondarily reddened Carboniferous may be thinner than normal beneath the Tormentil Volcanics, as in 110/2b-10. \r\n\r\nOn the wireline log of 110/2b-10, the base of the unit is marked by the abrupt and large downward increase in gamma values, and a small downward decrease on the sonic log. The 13-20 API gamma values displayed by the basalt are similar to those of thick Carboniferous sandstones (e.g. 110/20-1), and conceivably, where basalt rests directly on sandstone, there may be little gamma shift at the base of the unit.

Jackson et al. (1987) originally estimated a thickness of about 1450 m for the Namurian of the East Irish Sea Basin. Offshore, the Bisat Group has been proved to a maximum drilled thickness of 809.5 m in the E2-G1 succession of 112/30-1, though seismic data suggest that thicknesses of at least 2900 m may occur in the Quadrant 109 Syncline (Jackson and Mulholland, 1993). In 113/27-2, the apparently complete 588.5 m thick succession is likely to contain disconformities and to be internally faulted, since the E1 succession in the Roosecote borehole along strike to the east in south Cumbria exceeds 455 m (Rose and Dunham, 1977). In adjoining onshore areas, thicknesses range from an aggregate maximum of 2160 m along the depocentral axis in the Clitheroe area (Earp et al., 1961), through an estimated c. 365 m maximum in the south near the Point of Ayr (Ramsbottom, 1974), to a maximum preserved c. 60 m over the Ramsey-Whitehaven Ridge (Taylor, 1961; Ramsbottom, 1978).

The maximum thickness proved to date in available offshore wells is 485.5 m in 110/20-1, in a sequence dated by palynology as Langsettian to Duckmantian; this considerable thickness is comparable with equivalents nearby in south Lancashire (Ramsbottom et al., 1978).
