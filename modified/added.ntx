+<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/MORG> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The Morag Member is generally composed of white, pale grey, or occasionally pinkish grey anhydrite, with minor partings and thin beds of reddish brown, pale brown, and greenish grey mudstone (e.g. 21/18-2A, 28/12-1). The anhydrite is variously described from cuttings as being amorphous, cryptocrystalline, microcrystalline or sucrosic. Patches of halite have been recorded locally."@en .

It is marked by a sharp downward decrease in velocity, but where mudstone is present at the base of the member (e.g. 29/27-1) is associated with a sharp downward increase in velocity."@en .
+<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/TBAN> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLowerBoundaryDefinition> "The Turbot Anhydrite Formation is underlain by carbonates of the Halibut Carbonate Formation. Depending on the geographic location, these carbonates are assigned to the Argyll Carbonate Member (Z1), to the Innes Carbonate Member (Z2), or to an undifferentiated Z1/Z2 carbonate unit. The contact is commonly gradational, the boundary being defined where anhydrite replaces carbonate as the dominant lithology. An upper leaf of the anhydrite formation (its Morag Member) rests on the Shearwater Salt Formation across the centre of the Northern Permian Basin, the boundary being relatively sharp."@en .
