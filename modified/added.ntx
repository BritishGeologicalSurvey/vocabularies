The upper part of the member (Unit C) is characterised by tuffaceous sandy silt with laminae of fine-grained sand. The tephra layers are discontinuous. Microscopic tuffaceous material is disseminated through Units B and C (Jolley, 1996; King, 1981; Knox and Ellison, 1979). King (in prep.) describes more varied lithofacies from this part of the sequence. \r\n\r\nMarine: inner to mid shelf. \r\n\r\nEarly Eocene (early Ypresian)."@en .
+<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/WL> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The Woolwich Formation is typically composed of either dark grey shelly clay, laminated clay and silt or fine- to coarse-grained sand. Sporadic burrows occur throughout but bioturbation is more common in the higher beds, where sparse glauconite has been recorded. Shelly beds, particularly in the basal 2 m, are dominated by brackish water shells in dark grey clay matrix. Common plant debris is concentrated locally in thin allochthonous lignites, especially near the base. \r\n\r\nVery sparse occurrences of thin degraded ash deposits have been noted in south London and north-west Kent (King, in prep.; Knox and Morton, 1983). \r\n\r\nThe Woolwich Formation represents a variety of marginal marine facies of the Lambeth Group, with occasional freshwater incursions. \r\n\r\nMost, if not all, of the Woolwich Formation was deposited during the Early Eocene (earliest Ypresian). It possibly includes latest Paleocene deposits in the Shorne Member (Collinson et al., 2003)."@en .
