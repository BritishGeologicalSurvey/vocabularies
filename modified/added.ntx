Evidence for pedogenic carbonates is widespread. \r\n\r\nAllen and Mange-Rajetsky (1992) subdivided the Clair Group into 10 informal units. They recognised a Lower Clair Group (Units I to VI) and an Upper Clair Group (Units VII to X), separated by an unconformity. They also recognised another unconformity within the Lower Clair Group, subdividing the entire succession into three depositional cycles. The third cycle (Upper Clair Group) is the only cycle to contain evidence of marine influence. The two uppermost units contain increasingly grey mudstones, contrasting with the predominantly red strata of the rest of the succession."@en .
