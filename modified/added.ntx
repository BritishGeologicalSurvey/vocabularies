Some shells can be present and the beds may contain lignite and pyritised plant material. Sporadic burrows occur throughout, and bioturbation is more common in the higher beds in which glauconite occurs sparsely. These deposits are typically pale grey but may be olive to brown; they tend to be paler than those of the Lower Shelly Clay. Beds of sand, where present, tend to form broad sheet-like deposits, in contrast to the channel-like deposits found in the Reading Formation, although some cross-bedding is present (Ellison, 1983, citing F G Berry, personal communication). Locally, the Laminated Beds can comprise the entire local representation of the Woolwich Formation. \r\n\r\nKing (in prep.) notes that un-named channel-filling sand or clay bodies occur at the top of the Laminated Beds in places. \r\n\r\nThe Laminated Beds were deposited in estuarine and other marginal marine environments. \r\n\r\nEarly Eocene (earliest Ypresian)."@en .

The shell debris is concentrated into distinct beds or drifts (coquinas), which in some cases have been cemented to form limestones. The basal part is locally a shelly, clayey sand. \r\n\r\nThe Lower Shelly Clay represents deposition in marginal marine lagoons. In the far west, this environment occurred during a very brief interval, but in the east of the London Basin lagoonal conditions persisted for longer, depositing the lower part of the Woolwich Formation. However, in the east the depositional conditions also varied in time and space, resulting in the different lithologies of the lower Woolwich Formation. \r\n\r\nEarly Eocene (earliest Ypresian)."@en .

In the clays, red hues dominate with a more or less equal proportion of blue-grey and brown. Red to purple sediments decrease towards the east where there were shorter periods of subaerial weathering and pedogenesis, and reducing conditions in ephemeral lagoons. Beds of dark grey or black clay occur locally: these may be of significance for regional correlation at the interface between the upper and the lower parts of the Reading Formation. The proportion of sand beds varies greatly, and may constitute more than half the formation, dominantly in the basal part (e.g. Crane and Goldring, 1991; Ellison and Williamson, 1999, fig. 4). Fine-grained, bioturbated to laminated glauconitic sand with Ophiomorpha burrows is present in the Reading area. Gravelly sands with informational mud-flake breccias have been referred to as a marginal 'Lane End facies' by Daley (1999). See also White (1906). In parts of London, the upper part of the Lower Mottled Clay includes calcrete as diffuse nodules or as a more continuous layer of limestone. \r\n\r\nThe Reading Formation is considered to have been deposited mainly in various fluvial environments within a coastal flood-plain. However, Ellison et al. (1994) point out that primary sedimentary structures in the Reading Formation clays have been largely obscured, mainly by pedogenic processes, and that it is possible that some of the Reading Formation sediments originated in estuarine or other marginal marine environments. \r\n\r\nEarly Eocene (earliest Ypresian), possibly including the latest Paleocene (Thanetian), by reference to magnetostratigraphy and stable isotope stratigraphy."@en .
