Sandstones are quartzose, very fine- to coarse- or very coarse- grained, pale grey to white and sporadically glauconitic. Generally calcareous, although commonly friable. Interbedded mudstones and siltstones are pale to dark grey, calcareous, micromicaceous and locally carbonaceous. Sporadic white to pale grey and tan, microcrystalline and argillaceous, hard to soft limestone concretions produce high velocity spikes (e.g. well 12/30-1)."@en .

On wireline logs there is a downward increase in gamma-ray values and, commonly, an increase in velocity (e.g. 12/30-1)."@en .
