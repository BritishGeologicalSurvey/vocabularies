The limestone units usually display sharp contacts with the overlying and underlying mudstone or sandstone. In southern parts of the Central Graben in particular, laterally fed reworked chalk has mixed with axially transported sand to produce mixed lithologies that are difficult to identify precisely on the basis of wireline-log character. \r\n\r\nThe basal limestone in the south of Quadrant 3 locally grades into a calcarenite with abundant skeletal debris."@en .

The terms Bowland Shale Formation and Millstone Grit Formation are formally defined here as the offshore lithofacies equivalents of these groups. The Bowland Shale Formation is composed of basinal mudstones, whereas the Millstone Grit Formation encompasses a range of turbidite, delta-slope, deltaic, and fluvial braidplain facies. The Whitehurst Group is widespread in the central part of the UK Southern North Sea. Its southern limit is defined by onlap against the London-Brabant Massif. It is absent over the crest and southern flank of the Mid North Sea High, largely due to erosion following Variscan uplift. The base of the Whitehurst Group is regionally diachronous, ranging between late Asbian (Late Dinantian) and mid-Namurian in age. Underlying strata, where penetrated, are mainly Dinantian to early Namurian fluviodeltaic and minor marine sediments (Fame Group) or Dinantian platform carbonates (Zeeland Formation). Locally in the south, the Whitehurst Group rests on Lower Paleozoic basinal marine sediments. In the north of the area, and locally elsewhere, the Whitehurst Group is unconformably overlain by the Rotliegend Group. In central and southern areas, the Whitehurst Group is generally overlain conformably by the Conybeare Group. Onshore, the top of the Millstone Grit Group is marked by the Gastrioceras subcrenatum marine band, which coincides with the Namurian/Westphalian boundary (refer to Stubblefield and Trotter, 1957; Aitkenhead et al., 1992). Offshore, however, specific marine bands can be recognized only in cored sections, and the base of the group is therefore taken at the base of the lowermost coal seam, being up to 100 m above the Namurian/Westphalian boundary in those wells with good biostratigraphic control."@en .

The sandstone beds are white, pale grey, or pale brown, mostly less than 15 m thick, and constitute between 10% and 30% of the formation. Sand grain size is mainly very fine or fine, but the thickest beds are often coarser grained and are moderately or poorly sorted. Some sand beds are argillaceous; others contain abundant carbonaceous detritus. Minor pale grey siltstones occur within the argillaceous sections, but such sections tend to be dominated by dark grey and black carbonaceous mudstones, and are up to 30 m thick. Mudstones in the uppermost part of the formation have been affected by secondary reddening where they subcrop the base-Permian unconformity. The limestone beds are generally thin but exceptionally are up to 15 m thick, and comprise between 1% and 10% of the Yoredale Formation in different wells. The limestones are mainly microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline, white, pale grey, or brownish grey, and are argillaceous. Many limestone beds are fossiliferous; others are black, foetid, and unfossiliferous. Coal seams constitute less than 1% of the formation, and are generally less than 1 m thick. \r\n\r\nIn northern England, a typical Yoredale cycle comprises a basal marine limestone overlain by marine shales and a variety of delta-related sedimentary facies, often including seat earths and coals (Elliott 1975). Such cycles are between 15 m and 90 m thick in Northumberland (Leeder et al., 1989).
