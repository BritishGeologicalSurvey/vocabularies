Dispersed volcanic ash occurs in this unit. The basal gravel corresponds to the Bullhead Bed (BLHB). \r\n\r\nThe Base Bed Member is early Thanetian in age, and is inferred to represent Zone NP6 by inference from magnetostratigraphy (Ali and Jolley, 1996; Knox et al., 1994) and dinoflagellate cyst occurrence (Jolley, 1992; Powell et al., 1996)."@en .
