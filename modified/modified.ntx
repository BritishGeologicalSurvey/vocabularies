-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/AS> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "Heterolithic, consisting of grey, green and purple mudstones interbedded with paler grey-green to buff coloured siltstones and fine- to medium-grained, varicoloured green, brown, buff, mauve sandstones; beds of conglomerate occur locally. Laminated and thinly interbedded sediments are commonly extensively bioturbated and show structures indicative of thixotropic deformation. The siltstones and finer sandstones show small-scale ripple drift cross bedding; thicker sandstone beds show trough and planar cross bedding. The proportion of fine to coarse clastics varies laterally within the Formation. The thicker sandstone units, composed of several individual beds, have a lenticular geometry and occupy the inferred former courses of fluvial distributary channels in a deltaic or estuarine environment. Less arenaceous, mudstone and siltstone-dominated successions occupy intervening interdistributary areas. The Arden Sandstone Formation is differentiated from the reddish-brown, blocky weathering mudstones of adjacent formations by its predominantly greenish grey colour, the presence of a significant, though often subordinate, proportion of sandstone, and the predominance of finely laminated lithologies throughout."@en .
-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BAN> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The formation typically comprises pale green-grey, dolomitic silty mudstones and siltstones with thin arenaceous lenses and a few thin, commonly discontinuous beds of hard, dolomitic, pale yellowish-grey, porcellanous mudstone and silltstone (\"Tea Green Marl\" of Etheridge, 1865). In southern England and Wales only, the \"Tea Green Marl\" is overlain by the \"Grey Marls\" (Richardson, 1906). This unit (equivalent to the upper part of the Rydon Member and the whole of the Williton Member of Mayall, 1981) comprises grey, black, green and, rarely, red-brown dolomitic mudstones with, in the higher beds, yellowish-grey dolostones; also present are laminated siltstone beds with mudcracks, scarce pseudomorphs after halite, and locally abundant gypsum; miospores occur throughout and bivalve fossils and bioturbation become increasingly common upwards."@en .

The mudstones are mostly structurless, with a blocky weathering habit.  Gypsum/anhydrite, locally of economic importance, is common throughout in beds, nodules and veins.  Many of these sulphate beds have been named (e.g. Tutbury Gypsum and Newark Gypsum of the East Midlands) and form distinct markers on geophysical logs.  Sporadic thin beds of argillaceous sandstone and silty dolomite occur in the lower part of the formation.  Beds of thinly interlaminated, dark grey-green mudstone and dolomitic siltstone occur locally towards the top of the formation (formerly separated in the East Midlands as the Glen Parva Formation, Warrington et al., 1980).  Halite is recorded towards the base of the formation in Nettlecombe Borehole, Dorset, SY59NW/1, [SY50520 95440], but is absent elsewhere; halite pseudomorphs are rare."@en .

-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SIM> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The formation consists of dominantly mudstone and siltstone, red-brown with common grey-green reduction patches and spots. The mudstones are mostly structureless, with a blocky weathering habit, but intervals up to 15m thick of interlaminated mudstone and siltstone occur within parts of the formation, notably in the Bollin and Byley Mudstone members of the Cheshire Basin (Wilson, 1993) and in the Radcliffe Member of the East Midlands (Charsley et al., 1990). Heterolithic units consisting of several thin beds of grey-green dolomitic siltstone and very fine-grained sandstone, interbedded with mudstone, occur at intervals throughout the formation. These units range from a few centimetres up to 4m thick, and locally form mappable cuesta features. Named examples include the Cotgrave Sandstone Member and Clarborough Member of the East Midlands (Charsley et al., 1990; Smith et al., 1973; Warrington et al., 1980) and the Weatheroak Sandstone Member of the Redditch area (Old et al., 1991). Units of halite up to 400m thick are present at several stratigraphical levels in the thicker basinal sequences of the East Irish Sea, Cheshire, Staffordshire, Cleveland, Worcestershire, Somerset and Dorset, though are most prevalent towards the top. Breccias produced by contemporaneous dissolution of salt are common throughout the formation. In Cheshire, more recent salt dissolution (some induced artificially by brine pumping activities) gives rise to dissolution hollows and collapse breccias associated with the halite members. Gypsum/anhydrite also occurs throughout the formation as nodules and veins."@en .

The siltstones are micaceous and interlaminated with mudstones or sandstones; most of the mudstones appear structureless with a blocky habit. The sandstones are mostly very fine- to fine-grained, well sorted, and micaceous. They are typically cemented by ferroan calcite or dolomite. Sandstone beds are commonly less than 0.5m thick, though composite units, consisting of several individual sandstone beds, may reach over 5m thick. Intraformational mudclast conglomerates are common, with mudclasts concentrated at the bases of sandstone beds. Conglomerates with extraformational pebbles are rare and tend to be less than 1m thick; the \"Waterstones Conglomerate\" of Nottinghamshire is a notable example [Elliott, 1961]. Most mudstone and siltstone beds are reddish brown, though green-grey mottles and laminae are common. Gypsum occurs sporadically in the mudstones as small nodules. The sandstones are grey-brown and substantially paler than the siltstones and mudstones. Bedding is generally planar. Most beds are tabular and laterally extensive, though channel sandstones occur and typically have incised, erosional bases. The upper surfaces of sandstones and coarse siltstones are commonly wave or current rippled; in section the sandstones are usually planar or ripple-laminated, and exhibit sporadic rootlets."@en .
