-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/STAT> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The formation comprises interbedded sandstones, siltstones, mudstones and occasional minor coals.  In the East Shetland Basin, sandstones are pale grey to white, fine- to very coarse-grained, sometimes pebbly, micaceous, variably kaolinitic and sometimes cross-bedded.  Siltstones and mudstones are grey, green, reddish-brown, occasionally red, micaceous and sometimes carbonaceous. Coal seams up to 3.5 m thick occur locally. \r\n\r\nIn the Beryl Embayment sandstone beds usually have sharp bases and frequently form upward fining cycles. Cross-bedding and ripple-lamination are present. Carbonized wood is present. Thin sandstones, which are interbedded with siltstones, mudstones and coal, show parallel to sub-parallel laminations, ripple laminations and water escape structures.  The associated mudstones are mid-grey, generally blocky and massive (but occasionally fissile)."@en .

Uppermost bed is typically brown and grey mottled, highly bioturbated, shelly, bioclastic, ferru-ooidal, packstone with numerous bored Gryphaea, weathering to orange brown, and 0.61m thick in the type section. Below are one to three thinner, non-ooidal argillaceous limestone beds. Rich fauna including forams, serpulids, corals, brachiopods, gastropods and ammonites. Forms a strong scarp feature with a dip slope."@en .
-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/SYS> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The Formation comprises two members that are further divided:  Upper Spilsby Sandstone Member.  Thin, coarse-grained, grey or brown pebble sandstone with iron ooliths [Ferruginous Grit of Swinnerton, 1937].  Underlain by fine-to medium-grained, buff, yellow and white sands with sparse calcareous \"doggers\" [the upper part of Swinnerton's 1937, \"Glauconitic Sands\"]. The latter sands become coarser and greener towards the base of the Member. A bed of phosphatic nodules and small [generally chert] pebbles occurs at the base [the Mid Spilsby Nodule Bed of Casey [1963, 1973]. Lower Spilsby Sandstone Member. Coarse-grained, pebbly, glauconitic sands and sandstones with calcareous \"doggers\" and sporadic phosphatic nodules towards the Top [this unit equates with the lower part of Swinnerton's, 1937, \"Glauconitic Sands\"].  The base of the Member comprises a thin grey sandstone with phosphatic nodules [the \"Basement Beds\" of Swinnerton, 1937, and Beds A and D of Swinnerton, 1935."@en .
