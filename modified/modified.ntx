-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/FRNE> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The term Farne Group is introduced here for the Dinantian to early Namurian succession, largely of lacustrine, fluvial, coal-measures, and 'Yoredale' facies, that extends offshore from the Northumberland coast over the western crestal area and the southern flank of the Mid North Sea High. The succession continues eastwards into the Dutch sector, where it will also be designated the Farne Group (van Adrichem Boogaert & Kouwe, in preparation). None of the UK wells has penetrated the complete Dinantian succession. \r\n\r\nThe Farne Group rests on Upper Devonian to early Courceyan terrestrial sediments (Upper Old Red Group), the boundary being defined by the widespread appearance of dolomitic micrite beds (cementstones). In most wells, the group subcrops Upper Permian marine sediments and evaporites of the Zechstein Group. Where Namurian to early Westphalian basinal and deltaic deposits of the Whitehurst Group are also preserved beneath the base-Permian unconformity, the facies transition is diachronous. The group boundary is defined by the highest marine carbonate bed in the succession. The southern limit of the Farne Group is poorly constrained, as no wells have penetrated Dinantian strata in the central Southern North Sea area. \r\n\r\nIn the UK sector, the Farne Group is divided into four formations, three of which are named after their onshore equivalents, the Cementstone, Fell Sandstone, and Scremerston Coal groups of the Northumberland Trough (refer to George et al., 1976). The overlying Yoredale Formation is named after the Yoredale cycles which are its chief characteristic, and correlates with the Lower, Middle, and Upper Limestone groups of northeast England. Formational hierarchy has been adopted for the offshore units to conform with modern stratigraphical procedures (refer to Whittaker et al. 1991). With the exception of the Yoredale Formation, the Southern North Sea units are unlikely to be capable of subdivision."@en .

However, it becomes more sandy towards the south-east of its distribution (e.g. 12/28-1).  The mudstones are green, brick red, light grey and yellow, but they become predominantly red-brown with depth. They are occasionally calcareous, variably silty and fissile.  Rootlet horizons, highly laminated bituminous mudstone and limestone stringers occur.  Sandstones are upward-fining, cemented by authigenic silica, sometimes shelly and display a variety of planar and ripple cross-bedded structures.  Clasts of reworked limestone occur near the base of the formation and may be laterally equivalent to the Dunrobin Conglomerate Member onshore."@en .
