The distinction between sandstones of the Heimdal Sandstone Member and those of the underlying Maureen Formation is not always straightforward because the intervening Lista mudstone is often thin, and thus difficult to recognize in cuttings alone. In specific sections, the interpretations presented here differ from those of previous authors. Thus, sandstones in Quadrants 2 and 3, questionably assigned by Mudge & Copestake (1992) to the Maureen Formation, are here assigned to the Heimdal Sandstone Member on the basis of limited biostratigraphic evidence. Conversely, sandstones in the Beryl Embayment, assigned by Morton et al. (1993, fig.6) to the Heimdal Sandstone Member, are here included in the Maureen Formation; this interpretation is based on the consistent occurrence above these sandstones of a high-gamma marker (e.g. 9/13-4 & 9/19-7Z) that in well 9/18a-4 is associated with the <i>C. lenticularis</i> biomarker (Mudge & Copestake 1992, fig.5)."@en .
