-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/ORW> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The Orwell Member commences in glauconitic fine-grained sands (Unit A) with well-rounded flint gravel and faunal debris at the base, conformably overlain by bioturbated silty sands and sandy clayey silts with shell fragments and discontinuous laminae of dark grey-black claystone (Unit B). The upper part of the member (Unit C) is characterised by tuffaceous sandy silt with laminae of fine-grained sand. The tephra layers are discontinuous. Microscopic tuffaceous material is disseminated through Units B and C (Jolley, 1996; King, 1981; Knox and Ellison, 1979). King (in prep.) describes more varied lithofacies from this part of the sequence."@en .
-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/WL> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "Variable: largely grey to grey-brown, interlaminated fine-grained sands, silts and clays (also known as \"Striped loams\" (eg Dewey and others, 1924). Common plant debris concentrated locally in thin allochthonous lignites. Sporadic burrows throughout; bioturbation more common in higher beds, where sparse glauconite has been recorded. Shelly beds, particularly in the basal 2m, dominated by brackish water shells in dark grey clay matrix (\"Woolwich Shell Bed\"). Other lithofacies of local occurrence are limestone beds such as the \"Paludina Limestone\" (eg Berry and Cooper, 1977) at the top of the formation, and ferruginous sand and pebble beds (Ellison, 1983). Woolwich Formation not shown previously on maps."@en .

Base sharp, with burrows extending up to 0.5m into the underlying beds. The boundary with the Reading Formation in central and southeast London is very well defined and, as lithological and colour contrasts are pronounced, can be interpreted readily in most drillers' logs."@en .
