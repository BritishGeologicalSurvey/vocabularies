The zone of failure is not a well-defined shear surface. The coherent upper units may subside into softer underlying material and in doing so may rotate, tilt and eventually disintegrate. The term ‘spreads’ may also be used generally to qualify the description of a wide range of areally extensive superficial deposits."@en .
-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/TALU> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "Talus refers to the accumulation of angular rock fragments derived from steep rock slopes or cliffs by the mechanical weathering of the rock mass. The mass of talus is formed as a result of transport by gravity over short distances. It usually forms heaps or irregular talus sheets of coarse debris at the foot of steep slopes/cliffs (see also talus cone). Talus deposits include fallen rock debris, but here they are distinguished from landslip (‘rockfall’) deposits in that they are accumulations resulting largely from the spalling of rock fragments of all sizes due to natural weathering processes. They are not primarily due to rock falls which are usually joint-bounded masses or blocks breaking away from unstable slopes and triggered by non-weathering events such as seismic shocks and oversteepened scarps. Synonym: scree. \r\n\r\nClast-supported accumulation of angular rock fragments. May be active or inactive."@en .
