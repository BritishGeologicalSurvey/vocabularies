It thins to 10 to 15m over the Market Weighton High (Jeans, 1973) and its extension to Hornsea. It thickens immediately at the margin of the Cleveland Basin to the north, being 33 to 35m thick on the coast at Speeton (Wright, 1963; Jeans, 1980), and possibly 50m or more in boreholes inland near Fordon."@en .
