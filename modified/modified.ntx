The top of the Conybeare Group is a regionally angular unconformity. The Conybeare Group generally rests on 'Millstone Grit' facies of the Whitehurst Group, but oversteps the latter to onlap Dinantian carbonates and Lower Paleozoic basement along the northern flank of the London-Brabant Massif. The Group is divided into four formations. Boundaries between these formations are diachronous, and in some cases strongly so. The base of the Conybeare Group is defined by the lowest Westphalian coal seam, which occurs up to 100 m above the Namurian/Westphalian boundary in those few wells with good biostratigraphic control. \r\n\r\nThe term Caister Coal Formation is introduced for sandy Westphalian A to early Westphalian B coal measures; these are limited to the north of the UK Southern North Sea. \r\n\r\nThey are overlain by, and pass southwards by lateral transition into, argillaceous coal measures, here termed the Westoe Coal Formation. \r\n\r\nThe term Schooner Formation is introduced for a composite unit that incorporates these sandy coal measures together with overlying primary red mudstones and sandstones of Westphalian C age (Ketch Member). \r\n\r\nFarther south, primary red beds are also preserved in Variscan synclines along the flank of the London-Brabant Massif, but are largely Westphalian D in age there (Besly et al. 1993). They are underlain by a thin, condensed unit of late Westphalian C or Westphalian D coal measures which is believed to be separated from the underlying Westoe Coal Formation by an intra-Westphalian unconformity (refer to Tubb et al. 1986). The term Brig Formation is introduced for the composite unit incorporating the coal measures and red beds above this unconformity."@en .

This marl is equivalent to the East Cliff Marl 2 in Kent and is also identified at the Anstey Quarry [TL 395 329] south of Royston, in the \"Transitional\" Province. In the field, this is the most difficult boundary to place precisely as it falls in the sequence where the predominance of interbeds of hard chalk reduces in favour of soft chalk. The most positive criterion is the incoming of abundant thick-shelled inoceramid debris (Platyceramus) in soft chalks, although this might not be applicable everywhere. The presence of a sequence containing carious flints within the low Seaford Chalk and high Lewes Chalk is a helpful field indicator of the boundary.
