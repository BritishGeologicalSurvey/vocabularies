It includes floodplain alluvium and deposits of three river terraces. The floodplain alluvium comprises soft clays, silts and fine sands, with bodies of peat, all overlying sands and gravels. The terrace deposits include gravels, sands, silts and clays; the gravel clasts are dominantly local Jurassic limestones, Triassic sandstones and Carboniferous limestone, but also include some glacially-derived erratics from northwest England and the Welsh Borders."@en .

Floodplain alluvium comprises soft silts and clays, commonly with beds of peat and a basal bed of sand and gravel. River terrace deposits are largely sand and gravel. The gravels include a wide range of Palaeozoic and Mesozoic rocks, and much glacial material. Peat is a minor component, and minor marine deposits are included where they are intercalated in dominantly fluvial formations."@en .

River terrace deposits are largely sands and gravels. The gravels are composed of locally-derived rocks, variously Devonian sandstones, Carbonifeous sandstones and limestones.
