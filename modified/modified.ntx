The formation is about 68 m thick at Balintore. The lowermost unit the Cadh'-an-Righ Shale Member, is 4.2 m of sparsely fossiliferous bituminous fissile mudstone, with interbedded thin glauconitic siltstone, and includes the 0.5 m thick bioturbated sandstone of the Brora Roof Bed at the base. The overlying Shandwick Clay Member is about 28 m thick: the lower 24 m are bioturbated grey-green clay with layers of limestone nodules at the base, and the uppermost 4.1 m comprises sandy siltstone. Above is the Shandwick Siltstone Member - 12.1 m of fossiliferous siltstone, with alternating beds that are more or less calcareous. Overlying it is the Port-an-Righ Ironstone Member (Buckman, S S, 1923) comprising 2.2 m of muddy, glauconitic sand with interbedded bands of red-weathering nodular glauconitic limestone, all rich in ammonites. The overlying Port-an-Righ Siltstone Member is 21.7 m thick, and largely consists of relatively sparsely fossiliferous bituminous coarse silt. This unit comprises thin (0.1 to 1.8 m) rhythmic units that coarsen upwards from carbonaceous shale or silt, to fine-grained muddy sandstone. The uppermost bed is 5.7 m of fine-grained muddy sandstone. There is strong evidence that there are fine-grained beds above the Port-an-Righ Siltstone Member that are not exposed onshore (Sykes, 1975, p.62). The Balintore Formation yields marine biota and marine microfosils throughout. The macrofauna is dominated by ammonites and bivalves, with belemnites, brachiopods and gastropods, and dinoflagellate cysts are generally abundant and diverse (Riding, 2005)."@en .
