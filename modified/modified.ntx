The siltstones are micaceous and interlaminated with mudstones or sandstones; most of the mudstones appear structureless with a blocky habit. The sandstones are mostly very fine- to fine-grained, well sorted, and micaceous. They are typically cemented by ferroan calcite or dolomite. Sandstone beds are commonly less than 0.5 m thick, though composite units, consisting of several individual sandstone beds, may reach over 5 m thick. Intraformational mudclast conglomerates are common, with mudclasts concentrated at the bases of sandstone beds. Conglomerates with extraformational pebbles are rare and tend to be less than 1 m thick; the \"Waterstones Conglomerate\" of Nottinghamshire is a notable example (Elliott, 1961). Most mudstone and siltstone beds are reddish brown, though green-grey mottles and laminae are common. Gypsum occurs sporadically in the mudstones as small nodules. The sandstones are grey-brown and substantially paler than the siltstones and mudstones. Bedding is generally planar. Most beds are tabular and laterally extensive, though channel sandstones occur and typically have incised, erosional bases. The upper surfaces of sandstones and coarse siltstones are commonly wave or current rippled; in section the sandstones are usually planar or ripple-laminated, and exhibit sporadic rootlets."@en .

Within individual sections, the boundary is drawn arbitrarily within an interbedded, generally upward-fining gradation at the level where the micaceous mudstones, siltstones and fine sandstones of the Tarporley Siltstone predominate over the coarser grained, cross-stratified sandstone of the underlying Sherwood Sandstone Group (Warrington et al., 1980). Locally, for example above the Kibblestone Formation of the Stafford Basin (Rees and Wilson, 1998), the lowest part of the formation is dominated by sandstones. In these circumstances, the boundary is placed at the base of micaceous, flaggy and fine-grained sandstones, typical of the Tarporley Siltstone Formation, but differing markedly from the coarser, cross-stratified sandstones in the underlying Sherwood Sandstone Group. In the Cheshire Basin the junction between the Tarporley Siltstone Formation and the underlying Helsby Sandstone Formation is complex, being both transitional and diachronous, and locally there is a lateral passage between the two formations. For example, in the south-east of the basin, in the Stoke-on-Trent district (Rees and Wilson, 1998), siltstones, mudstones and thin sandstones (like those of the Tarporley Siltstone) alternate with thicker sandstones of Helsby Sandstone type; here the finer grained lithologies are included within the latter formation. This succession passes laterally into one where mudstones are dominant, assigned to the Tarporley Siltstone Formation. In the Nottingham area, the base of the unit is unconformable and is marked by a patchily distributed basal conglomerate up to 1 m thick with a strong calcareous cement (Howard, 2003; Howard et al., in press). Where not exposed, the boundary is typically marked by a change in soil type from the sandy soils of the Sherwood Sandstone Group to the heavier, brown sandy clay soils (commonly containing fragments of fine-grained micaceous sandstone) associated with the Tarporley Siltstone Formation. A concave break of slope may mark the boundary in some areas."@en .
