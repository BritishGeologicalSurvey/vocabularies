He considered this major brecciated unit as part of a larger 'Gwna Group' (Shackleton, 1969;1975) that also contained recognisable units ('formations') of  coarse sandstones, mudstones ('pelites') and spilitic lavas.  Although the name 'Gwna Group' has gained wide acceptance ( Gibbons 1991; 1994; Horak and Gibbons, 2000), Shackleton's stratigraphy has never been adopted, and the term 'Gwna Melange Formation' has fallen into disuse.  Its usage is not recommended because of confusion with the currently named Gwna Group. Recommend that the term Gwna Melange Formation is rendered obsolete."@en .
