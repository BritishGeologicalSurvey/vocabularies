Generally capped by bored, encrusted hardground (mapped on sheets 234 (1972 edition) and 251 (1970 edition) as \"chinastone\" or \"Coppice Limestone\" (Cave, 1977)). Lateral passage north-east into peloidal packstones and wackestones of the Ardley Member (White Limestone Formation), and the lower part passes south-westwards by decrease in ooid content into the Tresham Rock Formation. At Minchinhampton Common, about 0.5m of very shelly calcareous mudstone and brownish coarse-grained ooidal limestone beds ('The Scroff') occur at the base of the formation (Channon, 1950)."@en .

The formation includes a bored hardground on top of the Notgrove Member."@en .

The term glacigenic is taken to include deposits of glacial, glaciofluvial, glaciolacustrine and proximal glaciomarine origin together with associated periglacial and paraglacial units. The group comprises mainly, but not exclusively, the glacigenic deposits between the Anglian and Devensian ice-sheet limits of southern Britain. Deposits of this group are also present locally, both at the surface and as concealed sequences, in Britain within the main Devensian ice-sheet limit."@en .
