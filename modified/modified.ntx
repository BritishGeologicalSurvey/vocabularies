The base is gradational and taken at the incoming of more abundant and relatively thicker sandstones of the Crackington Formation above the mudstones with less than 10% sandstone in the underlying Dowhills Mudstones Formation. Between the Bideford area (SX 45 27) north Devon and the Westleigh area (ST 06 17), west Somerset, the base is taken at a  similar level. However, in the Bideford area, the base needs further investigation, as the Dowhills Mudstone Formation (Limekiln Beds of Prentice 1960a) was included in the Crackington Formation by Edmonds et al. (1979)."@en .

The base is gradational and taken at the incoming of dark grey mudstones with abundant thin- to medium-bedded turbidite sandstones of the Holsworthy Group (Crackington Formation) above the dark grey mudstones with sparse scattered thin turbidite sandstones of the underlying Teign Valley Group (Dowhills Mudstone Formation). Between the Bideford area (SS 45 27) north Devon and the Westleigh area (ST 06 17), west Somerset, the base is taken at a similar level. However, in the Bideford area, the base needs further investigation as the Limekiln Beds (Prentice 1960) included in the Crackington Formation by Edmonds et al. (1979) may be part of the Dowhills Mudstone Formation. South of the main crop, the Group occurs in tectonic slices between Bodmin and Dartmoor and no base is seen. The base here is thought to be unconformable on the underlying Teign Valley Group."@en .
