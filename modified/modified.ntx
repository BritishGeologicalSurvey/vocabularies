Some shells can be present and the beds may contain lignite and pyritised plant material. Sporadic burrows occur throughout, and bioturbation is more common in the higher beds in which glauconite occurs sparsely. These deposits are typically pale grey but may be olive to brown; they tend to be paler than those of the Lower Shelly Clay. Beds of sand, where present, tend to form broad sheet-like deposits, in contrast to the channel-like deposits found in the Reading Formation, although some cross-bedding is present (Ellison, 1983, citing F G Berry, personal communication). Locally, the Laminated Beds can comprise the entire local representation of the Woolwich Formation.\r\nKing (in prep.) notes that un-named channel-filling sand or clay bodies occur at the top of the Laminated Beds in places."@en .

The shell debris is concentrated into distinct beds or drifts (coquinas), which in some cases have been cemented to form limestones. The basal part is locally a shelly, clayey sand."@en .

Red hues dominate with a more or less equal proportion of blue-grey and brown. Red sediments decrease towards the east where there were shorter periods of subaerial weathering, and reducing conditions in ephemeral lagoons. The proportion of sand beds varies greatly, and may constitute more than half the formation, dominantly in the basal part (e.g. Crane and Goldring, 1991)."@en .
