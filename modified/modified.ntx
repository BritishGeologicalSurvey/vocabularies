-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BFB> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The Broadford Beds Formation is fully described by Morton and Hudson, 1995, though Hesselbo et al, (1998) contradict this and rename the units described. BGS maps are based on the former reference. The description includes BHLS, BRKH and ADS, which are also documented in the Lexicon. The lower Broadford Beds are dominated by carbonate rocks, calcareous mudstones and mature sandstones. Coral-rich beds are abundant in the lowermost parts and are overlain by restricted marine-fauna-rich lagoonal sediments. A shallowing of marine conditions from neritic deposition during Blue Lias times to nearshore/lagoonal is inferred. The upper Broadford Beds comprise sandstones and sandy siltstones. Typically these are highly micaceous and ferriginous. An ironstone bed with chamosite is found on the Ardnish Peninsula. A diverse marine faunal assemblage is common."@en .

In the Whitby area and coastal sections to the southeast, the formation consists mainly of grey, weathering yellow-brown, sideritic sandstone, medium- to coarse-grained, with sporadic phosphatic pebbles; berthierine (chamosite) ooids may be present. In central, north and west Cleveland there is a complex interdigitation between grey, weathering yellow-brown, berthierine (chamosite) ooidal ironstone (with siderite mudstone matrix) and pale grey limestone, medium-grained, bioclastic wackestone and packstone with peloids and ooids, generally bioturbated and locally cross-bedded.  In addition, partings, lenses and beds of grey, fossiliferous fissile mudstone may occur, and south-west of Malton, a distinctive iron-rich pebbly medium-grained sandstone facies is locally developed. Sandstones and ironstones are characteristically highly bioturbated and yield marine fossils including bivalves and scattered ammonites; corals, bryozoans, crinoids and brachiopods are locally present in the limestones."@en .

The boundary is less distinctive in the Peak Trough (Knox, 1984) (e.g. exposed at Blea Wyke; Ravenscar) [NZ 991 015] where the bioturbated sandstone of the Blea Wyke Sandstone Formation (late Toarcian in age ) is overlain by the yellow brown sandstone of the Dogger Formation (Aalenian in age), although at Blea Wyke the basal bed contains phosphate pebbles and casts of brachiopods (the Terebratula Bed) (Cox and Sumbler, 2002, pp. 357-361). In the Rosedale area, the base of the formation is generally marked by an ooidal ironstone with phosphatic pebbles sharply overlying bioturbated sandstone or ooidal ironstone of the Blea Wyke Sandstone Formation (Young, T P, 1994), although in localities where these lithologies repeat, the boundary may be difficult to place."@en .
