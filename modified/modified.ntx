Southern Province: Interbedded coloured marl and chalk. In the Southern Province, the Plenus Marls unit was defined by Jefferies (1963) and it is now treated at member level.  It marks the basal unit of the Holywell Nodular Chalk Formation. The Plenus Marl Member in the Northern Province, as defined in Sumbler (1999), included beds A to H of Dodsworth (1996) and thus contained the Black Band. The term was redefined by Hopson (BGS Research Report RR/05/02) to include only beds A and B of Dodsworth, with the higher beds C to H forming the newly proposed formal term Black Band Member. On this basis the Plenus Marl Member as defined in the Northern Province is the direct equivalent of the member as described for the Southern Province. No formal subdivisions are recognized, but the unit has been finely divided into eight beds of widespread geographical distribution in the Southern Province by Jefferies (1963)."@en .
