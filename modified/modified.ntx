Scattered beds of ill-sorted pebble to cobble conglomerate up to 2m thick contain clasts including chert, lava and limestone as well as derived Dinantian and ?Namurian fossils. Some channels are present."@en .
-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BF> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "Grey thick-bedded, somewhat argillaceous and silty sandstones, in laterally discontinuous internally massive beds 1-5m thick and commonly amalgamated into units up to 10m thick. When weathered the sandstones become buff and friable. Very thick beds of slumped and destratified strata are also present. Grey mudstones occur as interbeds up to 1m thick but locally packets of darker mudstone up to 20m thick with thin ironstone beds and bundles of thin sandstones are present, especially in the upper part of the Formation. Five named beds of black sulphurous \"shales\" with goniatite-bearing calcareous nodules occur within the Formation. Thin units of thin- to medium-bedded siltstones with Xithosurid trails are also present. \r\n\r\nDeposited in a large-scale freshwater lake situated on a broad shelf. Sandstone deposition was within storm wave base and by river-fed turbidity currents. Also, there was probably deltaic progradation across part of the basin late in its development. The goniatite-bearing mudstones represent periodic marine invasions."@en .
-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BFF> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "Mudstones with abundant thin to medium-bedded sandstones and siltstones with several thick units of thick-bedded sandstone. The upper two thirds of the sequence consists of nine coarsening upwards cycles (individually up to 180m thick) comprising in upwards order, black mudstone, silty mudstone, silt and sand-streaked mudstones, interbedded thin sandstones and mudstones, thick-bedded channelised cross-bedded sandstones capped by burrowed horizons and locally rootlets. The lower parts of some cycles contain units of thin-bedded 'Bourma-type' sandstone turbidites. Three of the thick cross-bedded sandstones capping the cycles are named, the topmost one being the Cornborough Sandstone. The lower third of the sequence (Westward Ho! Member) is not cyclic but comprises thin-bedded mudstones, siltstones and sandstones, some of which are turbiditic and others cross laminated and wave rippled. The Westward Ho! Member includes several channels filled by slumped and disturbed strata or, more rarely, cross-bedded or cross laminated sandstones."@en .

The mudstones contain scattered sideritic, carbonaceous silty sandstone and argillaceous limestone nodules, containing goniatites. A thin fossiliferous limestone is present at or very near the top of the Formation. Volcanic material locally occurs as lenses of sheared vesicular lava and tuff."@en .
