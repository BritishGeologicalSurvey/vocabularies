Well 53/19a-1 also encountered minor partings of shelly, argillaceous limestone and pale grey, microcrystalline dolomite. The sandstone beds constitute between 15 and 50 per cent of the formation (Tubb et al. 1986), and are up to 35 m thick. Most sandstones are argillaceous and are associated with a blocky log response; some of the thicker beds are composite and include mudstone partings. Grain size of the sandstones is mainly very fine or fine, but coarser beds have also been encountered in Block 53/12. \r\n\r\nThe coal-measures unit is largely composed of grey, purple and reddish brown mudstones and siltstones, but commonly includes two or three thin coal seams, and locally also includes thin, very fine grained sandstone beds. Sonic-log response for this unit is characteristically spiky, suggesting rapid alternation of these lithologies."@en .
