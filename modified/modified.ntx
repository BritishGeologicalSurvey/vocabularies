-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BRYD> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "This formation, which underlies much of the marshland in the Great Yarmouth district, is dominated by unconsolidated silt and clay with a shelly marine fauna. Sand is generally a minor component, though locally substantial sand bodies interrupt the argillaceous succession. Peat, of freshwater and brackish origins, is a major component adjacent to much of the marshland margin and particularly in the valleys of the River Yare and tributary streams. If also occurs as three widespread though locally inpersistent layers, at the base of the formation, within it, and at the top, mainly in the marshland fringe."@en .

Rhizomes of the salt-tolerant reed Phragmites occur throughout the clays and thin mats of rotted,drifted stems of reeds and sedges are common at many levels. At outcrop the silts and fine-grained sands that infill the creeks form low sinuous ridges or 'roddons'."@en .
