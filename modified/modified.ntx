Two members are recognised: The Wolf Crags Till Member is a yellowish brown sandy diamicton, with clasts of Borrowdale Volcanic Group and Skiddaw Group rocks, and subordinate numbers of clasts of Threlkeld Microgranite. The Wolf Crags Gravel Member forms a series of terraces in the Mosedale Beck valley. It is composed of coarse gravel (with clasts up to 1m diameter) with subordinate amounts of finer gravel and sand. It contains clasts of Borrowdale Volcanic Group rocks and Threlkeld Microgranite."@en .
