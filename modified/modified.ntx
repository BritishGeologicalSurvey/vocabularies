-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/FSG> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLithologyDescription> "The formation is composed of red and yellow sponge gravels, in the lower part of the unit, overlain by clayey sands and sandy clays and capped by ferruginous sands and sandstones.   The sponge gravels are highly fossiliferous, with abundant sponges, and \"the matrix is a coarse quartz sand with many small, smooth quartz and lydite pebbles\" (Arkell, 1947). The \"Red Gravel\" shows ferruginous staining. Locally thers is a pebble bed at the base.  Resting on an erosion surface, a pebble bed passes up into glauconitic sandy clays, clayey sands and silts. The clay minerals are dominantly calcium montmorillonite and illite with small amounts of Kaolinite and fuller's earth is well developed in two seams.  Brown, ferruginous, cross-bedded, medium to coarse-grained sands and sandstones, resting on an erosion surface, occurs at the top of the formation. Scattered pebbles, bands of grit and cherty sandstones also occur in places. Fossil fragments are common. The top of the member is indurated to form a hard sandstone which caps a number of hills in the Abingdon district."@en .

The Upnor Formation is likely to be composed of medium to coarse-grained sand that is greener and commonly more gravelly than that of the Thanet Formation but in places has a confusingly similar lithology, especially where, as in the far east of the London Basin, bioturbation has produced a gradational juction (Ellison et al.,1994). According to Morton (1982), the top of the Thanet Formation has been leached during a period of exposure, probably with some erosion, prior to deposition of the Upnor Formation. In the west of the London Basin, to the west of the Thanet Formation outcrop and subcrop, the Upnor Formation rests on a burrowed contact with chalk and flints of the Chalk Group, commonly modified by karstic dissolution. In East Anglia, the Upnor Formation rests on a burrowed contact with the clay of the Ormesby Clay Member."@en .
