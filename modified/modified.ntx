Equivalent, and probably slightly higher beds (extending up to about 220m above the base of the formation, according to Whitham, 1993) crop out inland, in the northernmost part of the Yorkshire Wolds, near Driffield. Still higher beds occur beneath drift in the Holderness\r\nregion where the formation, in boreholes, appears to total about 265m thick."@en .
