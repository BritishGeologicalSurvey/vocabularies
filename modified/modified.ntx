It is cross-bedded and festoon-bedded in part. In much of the Horsham district it is composed of \"sandrock\", a clean white or greyish white, soft quartzose sandstone that forms crags.  It becomes finer-grained towards the south of the Horsham district.  Locally, in the East Grinstead area, stringers of quartz and quartzite pebbles are common. The pebbles become larger towards Tunbridge Wells."@en .
