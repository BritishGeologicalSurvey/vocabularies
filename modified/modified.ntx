This horizon lies just below the Ravendale Flint, a tabular or semi-tabular flint up to 0.25m thick, which is the lowest such flint in the Chalk Group and base of the chalk unit in which such flint bands are common. The lowest few metres of the formation comprises hard chalks and thick, closely spaced, tabular flints, which produce a topographic feature by which the base of the formation can be mapped, and a characteristic geophysical log signature enabling its identification in boreholes."@en .
-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/WCK> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasLowerBoundaryDefinition> "The lower boundary is the base of the Plenus Marls Member, a unit of buff to green and grey marls and marly chalks, typically 0.5m thick but up to 1.4m in the Cleveland Basin. This rests on an uneven erosion surface that may be stained with iron minerals and glauconite, at the top of a succession of marly chalk (the Ferriby Chalk Formation). The marly basal beds generally form a topographical slack at outcrop, which facilitates the mapping of the base of the formation, and can also be recognised from their geophysical log signature in boreholes."@en .

North of the Humber, the Burnham Chalk Formation is 140m thick (Whitham, 1991) but it thins to 85 to 100m over the Market Weighton High. A complete section of the formation is exposed in the cliffs north of Flamborough Head, from Selwicks Bay to North Landing, where Rowe (1904) recorded a thickness of 105m. However, bed-by-bed measurements of the lower part of the formation indicate that it is thicker, perhaps 160m for the whole formation. The difference in these figures suggests that the top of the formation in the Cleveland Basin (as defined by the presence of flints) lies at a lower horizon than in the south, perhaps just above the Middleton Marl (based on preliminary correlation of geophysical logs)."@en .

It is thinner in the south, the equivalent beds averaging about 33m in north Norfolk (Peake and Hancock, 1970). It also may thin slightly across the Market Weighton High, perhaps to as little as 40m in places, but thickens again into the Cleveland Basin where the gamma-ray log of the Fordon No.2 borehole [TA 0689 7360] suggests it is about 55m thick. Whilst Rowe (1904; see also Neale, 1974) suggests it is about 68m thick in the Bempton and Buckton cliff sections between Flamborough and Speeton, according to Mitchell (2000) it is only 55m (cf. Fordon) at Speeton, its most northerly outcrop. Curiously, however, at Thornwick Bay, at the southeastern end of this section, measurement of the upper and greater part of the formation (see Whitham, 1991, (Figure 6, Column 7); Mitchell 2000) shows that it is slightly expanded relative to Speeton, suggesting a total of at least 60m there. This may indicate an eastward thickening towards the offshore extension of the Cleveland Basin, or an error in one or other of these sections, possibly related to structural complications."@en .

At Flamborough Head, this is the High Stacks Flint, but elsewhere may be at a different horizon. The change is particularly well marked on borehole sonic velocity logs."@en .
