Reefs are locally overlain by and pass into a flank facies comprising thin-bedded dark limestones and dolomites with cherts and thin mudstones. Stratigraphic position of flank facies uncertain and requires further investigation."@en .

The lower tongue comprises brown and red fine- to coarse-grained quartzitic sandstone with subordinate mudstones and sparse thin limestones. Base is locally conglomeratic.  The middle tongue is similar but contains units of dolomitised limestone. The upper tongue comprises grey and red coarse-grained quartzitic sandstones, sandy crinoidal and oolitic limestones, mudstones, siltstones and grey seatearths arranged in cyclic sequences. Units of crinoidal and oolitic limestone are locally developed. The formation was deposited mainly in a fluvial environment on a marine influenced coastal plain."@en .

From the base these members are Shellesder, A'Mharagach, Sgaorishal and Allt Dubh.\r\nThe base of the unit lies directly on the Torridonian and comprises coarse, continental-derived conglomerates. Gradually the succession fines upwards and the top 25m (two members) are dominated by fine sand and lacustrine carbonate rocks with ostracods."@en .
