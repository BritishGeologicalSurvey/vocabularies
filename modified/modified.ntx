Ooliths locally occur in the mudstones in the upper part.  Thin, varicoloured, very fine- to coarse-grained, argillaceous sandstones occur locally, and may be kaolinitic and/or calcareous."@en .

The group is defined as containing the following formations: \r\n\r\nAmundsen Formation \r\n\r\nBurton Formation \r\n\r\nCook Formation \r\n\r\nDarwin Formation \r\n\r\nDrake Formation \r\n\r\nSpeke Formation"@en .

A weak downward decrease in gamma values and increase in velocity occurs across the boundary."@en .

A weak down-section increase in gamma values coincides with the boundary."@en .
-<http://data.bgs.ac.uk/id/Lexicon/NamedRockUnit/BURT> <http://data.bgs.ac.uk/ref/Lexicon/hasUpperBoundaryDefinition> "The upper boundary is typically characterised by a downward change from siltstone or sandstone (Cook Formation) to mudstone and a distinct down-section increase in gamma values and decrease in velocity.  Locally development of sandstone in the Burton Formation (e.g. 3/4-8) makes the boundary difficult to locate.  Local anomalously high gamma values in the Cook Formation mean that the boundary is best defined by the down-section decrease in velocity on wireline logs."@en .

This is placed at a downward change from sandstones (Broom Formation) to mudstones and a downward increase in gamma values. Locally there is a downward change from micaceous mudstones (of the Rannoch Formation) to poorly micaceous mudstones accompanied by a decrease in gamma values and increase in velocity."@en .

The boundary coincides with a sharp down-section increase in gamma values."@en .
