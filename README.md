## Vocablary vs Ontology

The difference between a vocablary & ontology can be sujecive, and is generally around the level of complexity. 

> "A Controlled vocabulary is a list of terms that describes a certain domain of knowledge. In the controlled vocabulary you only use one term to describe one particular phenomenon, excluding all other synonyms. The vocabulary should provide a definition for the term, and any synonyms. In a publicly managed controlled vocabulary, the terms should also have unique identifiers, so that they can be referenced.
>
>An ontology (in this context) is a controlled vocabulary, that apart from being a list of agreed terms, also captures relationships between these terms."
