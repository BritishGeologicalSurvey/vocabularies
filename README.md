# BGS Vocabularies

## Introduction

The British Geological Survey (BGS) publishes vocabularies - a way to describe things and the relationship between things.

A vocabulary is a set of agreed terms:
* In BGS, a vocabulary defines the terms used to describe and represent things in the domain of science and data management.
* Vocabularies align information within a business area or across systems.
* Vocabularies can be very complex (with thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts only).
